#Regression Analysis â€“ What makes us happy? 
##Objectives
(1) Develop regression model in R to establish and evaluate relationship between happiness score and various socioeconomic, demographic, and health indicators; 
(2) identify variables that are the most impactful in predicting the happiness score.

Happiness score is published annually in the World Happiness Report by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. Happiness score is calculated based on respondents estimate of their own lives. Each country has a sample size of 2000 to 3000 respondents that complete a comprehensive survey about their lives that feeds into the total happiness score. This analysis considers happiness score to be the dependent variable. 

On the other hand, the World Bank gathers data that represents various socioeconomic, demographic, and health indicators. The open database has very rich collection of indicators that describe essentially every part of our lives. 

What makes one country happier than its neighbors? What socioeconomic, demographic or health indicators can help predict happiness score in a given country? And what makes us happy? To answer these questions, multiple regression analysis can be used. 

As in any modeling exercise a 5-step approach will used: 
1.	Collect data
2.	Explore and prepare the dataset for analysis 
3.	Train model on the dataset
4.	Evaluate model performance
5.	Improve the model
